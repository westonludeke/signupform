## Sign-Up Form App

### Project Description

This is a webpage with a sign-up form designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Project Goals & Details

The goal of this project was to create a sign-up form that validates each field when it loses focus as well as when the "Sign Up" button is clicked. Students were asked to not use the browser's built-in error message mechanism.

The project was built as part of [Launch School's JS230 course](https://launchschool.com). The site can [be viewed live via GitHub Pages here](https://westonludeke.github.io/signupform/).
