## Sign-Up Form App

### Project Description

This is a sign-up form for a web app and was designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Project Goals & Details

This is a sign-up form for a web application that requires users to provide their first name, last name, email, and password, with the option of including a phone number. 

The form is designed using HTML and CSS and has validation that runs when users try to submit the form. If there are any validation errors, the form will not submit and the user will see error messages that correspond to the invalid form fields. If there are no errors, the form will submit and the user will be redirected to the application's main page. The validation logic is implemented in JavaScript and uses event listeners to monitor the form fields for changes. If a field's value is invalid, the corresponding error message is displayed. When the user corrects the invalid value, the error message disappears.

The project was built as part of [Launch School's JS230 course](https://launchschool.com). The site can [be viewed live via GitHub Pages here](https://westonludeke.github.io/signupform/).
